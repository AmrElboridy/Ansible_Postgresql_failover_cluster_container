# Ansible_Postgresql_failover_cluster_container
Ansible playbooks to deploy Postgresql failover cluster using containers over different virtual machines 
The archticutre contains 3 VMs 
for each VM, we will deploy 2 containers one as a nginx and the other one is Postgresql 
The idea is to create fullover cluster for the postgresql Containers using ansible playbook
